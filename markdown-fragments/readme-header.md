sjljs
=====

## Aside Note:
Spiritual successor to sjljs: [fjl (Functional javascript library)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fjl)
 This library has everything required for writing a better sjljs and actually makes most of 
 the sjljs methods moot (though may be a bit to take in since it is a functional library (fp unversed you've been warned!))
[try it out](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fjl) and/or have a look at the [docs here](https://functional-jslib.github.io/fjl/).

## Intro
A library for writing strongly typed javascript and solid classical oop.  Also for making your applications, components,
and libraries more concise. 

Not meant to replace popular libraries like Backbone, Underscore, or Jquery etc..  Only meant as a supplement to them 
or as a supplement to applications requiring quick ramp up.

### Note: 
#### (This change only affects node users)
Reinstated all members of `sjl.ns.stdlib` to also be available on `sjl.stdlib...`
and also to be accessible directly on `sjl`.
